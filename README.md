**About**
Leveraging the potential of remote sensing for planning, monitoring and evaluating projects is MAPME’s primary objective. It is a joint initiative by KfW, MapTailor Geospatial Consulting GbR, and Agence Française de Développement (AFD). MAPME is an open framework that develops and promotes open source data and tools for the relevant project management stages. It consists of the following core components: (i) Good practice guidance that describes workflows for using remote sensing data and products for planning, monitoring and evaluation; (ii) Project-related support with remote sensing analyses. Open source code and tools provided via open code repositories; (iii) User-tailored trainings. More information can be found on the MAPME project homepage.
